The README can be fully written in English while keeping a GitHub-friendly, clear structure based on your two workflows.​

Below is the English README version.

🧠 TaskFlow – N8N Workflows
This repository contains the N8N workflows that extend TaskFlow with AI-powered task enrichment and WhatsApp integration.​

Description_Enrich.json: AI workflow to automatically enrich task descriptions.​

Task_Manager_Whatsapp.json: main workflow to manage TaskFlow via WhatsApp (commands + natural language).​

📂 Included Workflows
1. Description_Enrich
This workflow is executed by other workflows to generate or update a task description using AI.​

What it does

Receives a freshly created (or updated) task.

Uses an AI agent (OpenAI) to write a clear description and optionally a short checklist (3–5 items).

Updates the task in the TaskFlow backend with the enriched description.​

⚙️ Description_Enrich – Detailed Flow
High-level flow
Triggered by another workflow via Execute Workflow Trigger.​

Normalizes the incoming payload to extract taskId, title, and userId.​

Calls an AI Agent with a tailored prompt to generate description and optional checklist.​

Normalizes the AI output (plain text or JSON-like) into a single description string.​

Sends a PATCH request to TaskFlow API to update the task description.​

Nodes
1. When Executed by Another Workflow
Type: executeWorkflowTrigger.

Input: any payload that contains the created task data.​

Example pinned payload:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "c290cbca-bc2e-4421-ba33-6e434bf96d7d",
    "user_id": "26e90e24-cdc8-4c35-a6c2-8cce46140ee1",
    "title": "prepare a brownie",
    "description": null,
    "is_completed": false,
    "created_at": "2025-12-19T18:14:56.118638+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2025-12-19T18:14:56.118638+00:00"
  }
}
2. prepare_enrich_payload (Code)
Type: n8n-nodes-base.code.

Purpose: extract the minimal payload for the AI and API calls.​

js
const created = $json.data?.task || $json.data || $json;

return {
  taskId: created.id,
  title: created.title || '',
  userId: created.user_id || $json.userId || null,
};
Output example

json
{
  "taskId": "c290cbca-bc2e-4421-ba33-6e434bf96d7d",
  "title": "prepare a brownie",
  "userId": "26e90e24-cdc8-4c35-a6c2-8cce46140ee1"
}
3. AI Agent
Type: @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent.

promptType: define.​

Prompt (simplified):

You are an assistant that writes helpful task descriptions for a personal task manager.

Write a concise, clear description of the task.

Optionally add a short checklist with 3–5 bullet points.

Keep everything under 120 words.

Use simple, direct language.

Do not mention that the text was generated by AI.

You may enrich based on the title, describe step-by-step execution, or search for relevant information and include links as references.​

The text sent to the agent:

text
Task title: "{{ $json.title }}"

Generate the description and optional checklist.
4. OpenAI Chat Model
Type: @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi.

Model: gpt-4.1-mini.

Credentials: OpenAi account configured in N8N.​

This node is used as the language model for the AI Agent.​

5. merge_enriched (Code)
Type: n8n-nodes-base.code.

Purpose: merge AI output with base task data and normalize the description.​

js
const base = $node['prepare_enrich_payload'].json;
const ai = $json;  // AI Agent output

let description = ai.output || ai.text || '';

// If the output is a JSON string, try to parse
if (typeof description === 'string' && description.startsWith('{')) {
  try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(description);
    description = parsed.description || parsed.text || description;
  } catch (e) {
    // keep as is
  }
}

return {
  taskId: base.taskId,
  userId: base.userId,
  description: description.trim(),
};
Resulting payload

json
{
  "taskId": "c290cbca-bc2e-4421-ba33-6e434bf96d7d",
  "userId": "26e90e24-cdc8-4c35-a6c2-8cce46140ee1",
  "description": "Enriched task description, potentially with a checklist."
}
6. Update_Task_Description (HTTP Request)
Type: n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest.

Method: PATCH.

URL:

text
https://task-flow-bruno-c.vercel.app/api/tasks/{{ $json.taskId }}?userId={{ $json.userId }}
Body:

json
{
  "description": "={{ $json.description }}",
  "userId": "={{ $json.userId }}"
}
Responsibility: persist the enriched description in the TaskFlow backend.​

📲 Task_Manager_Whatsapp – High-level Overview
The Task_Manager_Whatsapp.json file contains the full WhatsApp workflow: webhook, parsing, AI intent detection, commands, and responses. This section documents the behavior at a high level so the file can stay the single source of truth for detailed node configuration.​

Goals
Receive incoming messages from WhatsApp via Evolution API.

Decide whether the message is:

A command (/task ..., #to-do-list, etc.).

A natural language request about tasks.

Call the TaskFlow API (/api/tasks) and, when relevant, call Description_Enrich for AI enrichment.

Reply to the user with formatted WhatsApp messages (task lists, confirmations, errors).​

Typical flow
Webhook (Evolution API → N8N)

Receives message payload (message, from, senderName, etc.).​

User resolution

Extracts phone number.

Resolves or creates a userId associated with that phone in TaskFlow.​

Intent detection

If the message starts with /task, it is treated as a structured command.

Otherwise, AI is used to interpret the user request (create/list/complete/remove tasks).​

Task API calls

POST /api/tasks to create tasks.

GET /api/tasks?userId=... to list tasks.

PATCH /api/tasks/:id to complete or edit tasks.

DELETE /api/tasks/:id to remove tasks.​

Optional enrichment

After creating a task, the workflow may call Description_Enrich to generate a richer description and checklist.​

Response formatting and send

Builds human-friendly messages with emojis, numbering, and shortened IDs.

Sends the final message back via Evolution API HTTP request to WhatsApp.​

🚀 How to Use These Workflows
1. Import into N8N
Open the N8N UI.

Click Import from file and select both Description_Enrich.json and Task_Manager_Whatsapp.json.​

2. Configure credentials
OpenAI: configure the OpenAi account used by the OpenAI Chat Model node.​

Evolution API: configure credentials (base URL, instance ID, token) in the HTTP Request nodes that send and receive WhatsApp messages.​

3. Adjust URLs
Replace https://task-flow-bruno-c.vercel.app with your own TaskFlow base URL in all HTTP Request nodes, especially Update_Task_Description and the nodes inside Task_Manager_Whatsapp.​

4. Activate workflows
Set both workflows to active in N8N so they start processing incoming webhooks and internal calls.​

You may use these workflows as part of the TaskFlow project.
